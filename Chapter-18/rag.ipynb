    "## Background / overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to build RAG implementations on Vertex AI. In Chapter 17, we implemented a RAG solution using Vertex AI Search. Remember what we've mentioned numerous times throughout this book: When there are multiple potential ways of implementing a solution, a solution architecture best practice is to always use the most managed solution possible that meets yourn technical and business needs (which may include cost, but that cost should always be considered in terms of \"total cost of ownership\" (TCO), which includes the toil of building and managing solutions ourselves). \n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, when implementing a RAG solution in Vertex AI, I recommend starting with Vertex AI Search, as we did in Chapter 17. However, if you want to build your own RAG solution from scratch, in which you perform document chunking and embedding explicitly yourself, you can use services such as Google Cloud Document AI and Vertex AI Vector Search (among others)."

    "## Solution Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution architecture is shown in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/RAG-Vertex.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in the diagram are described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our documents, which are stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), are sent to Google Cloud Document AI for chunking. As the name suggests, the chunking process breaks the documents into “chunks,” which are smaller sections of the document. This is required in order to create standard-sized chunks that serve as inputs to the embedding process. The size of the chunks is configurable in Document AI, and further details on this process are described in the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "2. The chunks are then sent to the Google Cloud “textembedding-gecko” LLM to create embeddings for the chunks. The resulting embeddings are stored in GCS, alongside their respective chunks (this step is omitted from the diagram).\n",
    "3. We create a Vertex AI Vector Search index, and the embeddings are ingested from GCS to the Vertex AI Vector Search index (the GCS intermediary step is omitted from the diagram).\n",
    "4. Next, the application/user asks a question that relates to the contents of our documents. The question is sent as a query to textembedding-gecko to be embedded/vectorized.\n",
    "5. The vectorized query is then used as an input in a request to Vertex AI Vector Search, which searches our index to find similar embeddings. Remember that the embeddings represent an element of semantic meaning, so similar embeddings have similar meanings. This is how we can perform a semantic search to find embeddings that are similar to our query.\n",
    "6. Next, we take the embeddings returned from our Vertex AI Vector Search query and find the chunks in GCS that relate to those embeddings (remember that Step 2 in our solution created a stored association of chunks and embeddings).\n",
    "7. Now, it’s finally time to send a prompt to Gemini. The retrieved document chunks from Step 6 serve as context for the prompt. This helps Gemini to respond to our prompt based on the relevant contents from our documents and not just from its pre-trained knowledge.\n",
    "8. Gemini responds to the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, between some of the steps depicted in the diagram, Google Cloud Storage is used to store the inputs and outputs of each step, but those intermediary processes are omitted to make the diagram more readable. Also, when we implement this solution here in our Jupyter Notebook, the notebook is the “application/user” that coordinates each of the steps in the overall process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in this case, we are using documents stored in GCS as our source of truth, but we could also use other data, such as data stored in BigQuery."

The participants were randomly assigned to take cinnamon (4~g/d) or placebo for 4-wk, followed by a 2-wk washout period, and then crossed over to the other intervention for an additional 4-wk. Glucose changes were measured with continuous glucose monitoring. Oral glucose tolerance testing immediately following ingestion of cinnamon or placebo was performed at 4-time points to assess their acute effects both at the baseline and end of each intervention phase.

This diet was maintained for the entire 12 wk of the study. After the 2-wk run-in phase, the partic- ipants were randomly assigned to ingest cinnamon (16~capsules-4~g/d) or placebo for 4 wk, followed by a 2-wk washout phase, then crossed over to the other intervention for an additional 4 wk (allocation ratio 1:1). Three-day food intake records were obtained during the screening process and at subsequent clinical visits. Patient eligibility for the study was determined during screening by assessing the participants\\' dietary habits and compliance with the low fiber/polyphenol diet, which was based on the analysis of their 3-d food records and consultations with a dietitian. Participants were given a low fiber/polyphenol diet handout providing nutritional guidance about the diet that was maintained for the study duration. Cinnamon (C. burmannii - Indonesian cinnamon) was administered in 250 mg capsules. Participants took 8 capsules with breakfast and 8 capsules with dinner (16 capsules or 4~g/d). Participants took the same number of placebo capsules that contained 250 mg of maltodextrin and were identical such that the participants could not tell the difference between them.

On each testing day, subjects were evaluated at the University of California, Los Angeles Center for Human Nutrition following an 8-12 h fast. An indwelling catheter was inserted into a forearm vein, and a baseline (0 h) fasting blood sample was collected. Between blood draws, the catheter was flushed with saline through it for the entire experiment to prevent clothing or blockages. A trained nurse was responsible for the entire OGTT pro- cedure. She was responsible for ensuring that the cannula remained patent, collecting blood samples at the correct time intervals, and addressing any complications that may arise. The subjects then ingested 75 g of glucose cola within a 5-min time period along with 8 capsules (2 g) of cinnamon or placebo. Blood samples (10 mL) were drawn every 30 min for 3 h. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, glucose-dependent-insulinotropic-polypeptide (GIP), Glucagon-like Peptide-1, and triglyceride concentrations (Supplemental Data 4) were measured. A stool sample was collected the day before each visit (4 visit days; Supplemental Table 1; Supplemental Data 5). Weight, body composition, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured after participants arrived at the Center for Human Nutrition at each visit after resting for 15 min (Supplemental Table 1). Percent body fat, fat mass, lean body mass, total body water, and basal metabolic rate were measured using bioelectrical impedance (BIA310e; Biodynamics Corporation, Tanita-BC418 body-fat analyzer; Tanita Corporation) [7]. Blood and fecal SCFA content were analyzed by gas chromatography. The concentrations of serum and fecal acetic, propionic, butyric, iso- butyric, valeric, and isovaleric acids were quantified. Additional in- formation regarding gut microbiome and serum and fecal SCFA analysis are found in Supplemental Data 5.\"\n",

Based on these results, 14 participants would be needed to achieve 80% power, and 18 participants would be needed for 90% power to detect a significant reduction in fasting glucose con- centrations of 2~mmol/L with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 [5]. Recalculation of study power based on our sample size (n=18) and anticipating a reduction in glucose of 2~mmol/L and a 2-sided signif- icance level of 0.05 yielded a study power of 93.8% [5]. Continuous variables were presented as mean ± SD unless specified otherwise. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages with IQRs. Baseline characteristics were presented for the entire study population. Participants were seen in the clinic every 2 wk for the placement of CGM sensors. These visits occurred in the morning, at ~08:00. CGM data for each individual were collected and organized into daily seg- ments (24 h - from around 08:00 to 08:00). To establish the start time for each day, we calculated the mean time of day the glucose sensor was applied for each person (start time ranged between 07:30 and 08:30). We excluded days that were not representative of normal daily activity, such as days when OGTT was performed and the first 24 h after applying the sensor. We calculated the mean glucose concentra- tions (every 15~min/d) for each participant for the 2 interventions (cinnamon or placebo). Eventually, we had a day with 96 glucose mean observations (every 15 min) for each intervention. Glucose concen- trations were reported as changing relative to the initial glucose mea- surement. CGM data processing was performed by an analyst blinded to the intervention (HZ). Statistical analysis was performed by an un- blinded investigator. Glucose changes were assessed by calculation of the glucose AUC using the net incremental AUC method (netAUC) [25-27]. NetAUC calculation includes the areas below a curve, both above and below the level of fasting time periods. The netAUC can result in values <0 since it is calculated as positive and negative blood glucose increments. Within-subject differences were determined by estimating the mean net incremental area under the 24-h glucose-time curve [25-27] and tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon Signed rank testing. Individual glycemic-response parameters were also determined: peak glucose height, peak start time, time to glucose peak, and mean peak duration. Peak values were determined from the difference of the highest measurement relative to the mean glucose concentration for the corresponding time period. Statistical significance between cinnamon and placebo glycemic responses was determined by Wilcoxon Signed rank testing. Mixed-model analysis was used to evaluate the difference between cinnamon and placebo CGM trajec- tories (the pattern of serial glucose readings taken at different time points), taking into account within and between-subject differences. Mixed-model analysis was performed, treating subjects as random effects (within-subject test) with the intervention as a fixed effect (between-subject factor) and the outcome being the glucose concen- tration. Additional adjustments for potential confounders were added to the model (sex, age, and FPG at baseline/HbA1c at baseline/systolic or diastolic blood pressure). Mixed-model analysis was also used in the OGTT analysis (every 30 min over 3 h after glucose load). Exploratory analysis comparing differences between various time points during OGTT used Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Addi- tionally, we assessed insulin sensitivity with the OGTT test using the Matsuda Index: [10,000 /√(FPG x fasting plasma insulin) X (mean glucose OGTT x mean insulin OGTT)] [28]. Differences between cinnamon and placebo effects on serum and fecal SCFA, anthropo- metric, and body composition measurements were evaluated by the\"\n",

Potential carryover effects from the first phase treatment allocation were minimized with the 2-wk washout period that should have been sufficiently long for the cinnamon effect to be depleted [4]. The washout period in our study is consistent with previous publications that employed a washout period of 7-20 d (2,5,6). The risk of potential carryover effects was evaluated by the interaction of the intervention order and the treatment in repeated mixed-models [29]. Effect size was calculated as Eta-squared (\\\\eta^{2}). Statistical significance was assumed if the 2-sided P<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 29.0 software. Graphs were constructed using GraphPad Prism 9 by Dot- matics.

Cinnamon consumption reduced mean netAUC over 24 h compared with placebo (cinnamon: -1265.2\\\\pm9027.3~mg/dL^{*} min compared with placebo: 1914.6\\\\pm9223.4~mg/dL^{*} min, ES=-0.66, 95% CI: 2501.7, 5412.1, P=0.01). The overall repeated glucose concentrations over 24 h were significantly lower at all time points in the cinnamon intervention compared with the placebo (ES = 0.96, 95% CI: -2.9, -1.5, P<0.001. The mean starting peak time, the time to peak, and the mean duration of the peaks were not significantly different between the interventions (P>0.05; Supplemental Table 3). The difference in the glucose trajectories between cinnamon and placebo remained strongly significant after adjusting for age, sex, and HbA1c at baseline/ FPG at baseline/systolic or diastolic blood pressure at baseline per- formed in multivariable repeated measurement models (P<0.001). The potential for the carryover effect of cinnamon from the initial to the final time period was evaluated by testing for an interaction between treatments, and the order of intervention allocation was not statistically significant (P=0.5). Individual continuous blood glucose concentra- tions are presented in Supplemental Figure 2. ITT analysis showed similar results between the imputed results and the perprotocol data. The ITT analysis can be found in Supplemental Figure 1. Sensitivity analysis exploring continuous glucose trajectories after cinnamon ingestion compared with placebo, excluding participants number 2, 5, 12, and 15, was similar to the perprotocol analysis (Supplemental Figure 3).\"\n",

GIP after 4 wk of cinnamon was significantly increased relative to baseline (mixed-models; ES=0.51, 95% CI: 1.56, 100.1, P=0.04). Glucagon concentrations following the cinnamon intervention were significantly lower as compared with the placebo (mixed-models; ES = 0.66, 95% CI: 2.0, 10.9, P=0.005). Mixed-model analysis found that cinnamon supplementation statisti- cally significantly decreased triglyceride concentrations as compared with baseline (mixed-models; ES = 0.55, 95% CI: -16.0, -1.6, P= 0.02). We did not identify this difference with netAUC. AUC has less statistical power to detect differences than mixed-model analysis because the information is lost when individual data points and the time in which they occur are averaged together as an AUC. The differences in glucagon, GIP, and triglyceride changes remained significant following adjustments for baseline and changed body composition (body weight, fat-free mass, or fat percentage). Numerical results for pre and post-OGTT are shown in Supplemental Table 4. The Matsuda Index showed no differences in insulin sensitivity between baseline and the end of each intervention [medians (IQR): cinnamon baseline: 0.04 (0.02-0.06); cinnamon end: 0.04 (0.02-0.08); P=0.4; placebo base- line: 0.05 (0.02-0.09); placebo end: 0.04 (0.03-0.08); P=0.8).

Our OGTT findings were similar to a previous study that showed that cinnamon did not affect postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations [30]. OGTT testing has less than optimal reliability, accuracy, and reproducibility [31]. Because it measures glucose over long time periods, 24-interstitial glucose moni- toring may be superior to OGTT in detecting dysglycemia in impaired glucose tolerance [32,33]. CGM is a powerful tool that has the principal advantage of capturing glucose fluctuations (short-term glycemic vari- ability) [34,35]. Our study may differ from those that did not find an effect of cinnamon on glucose concentrations because we employed 24-h CGM, which is a more sensitive measure of glucose changes than other methods.\"\n",

Post- prandial hypertriglyceridemia has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, and reducing elevated concentrations of postprandial triglycerides may reduce the risk of coronary artery dis- ease [36-38]. Our study found that adding cinnamon to the diet may reduce overall postprandial triglyceride concentrations. However, tri- glyceride concentrations fluctuated during the OGTT in our study,\"\n",

In addition, we observed that GIP concentrations were increased after 4 wk of cinnamon intake. GIP, an incretin produced in the intestinal mucosa, increases insulin concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner while also promoting ẞ-cell proliferation and survival [43-46]. GIP stimulates adipocyte li- poprotein lipase activity, resulting in hydrolysis of circulating tri- glycerides [47,48].

Our previous in vitro study demonstrated that cinnamon and other spices strongly influenced bacterial growth by enhancing the growth of Bifidobacterium spp and Lactobacillus spp, with inhibitory activity against selected Ruminococcus species, Fusobacterium strains and selected Clostridium spp [55]. One prior study in healthy participants showed that daily consumption of a spice mix resulted in a significant reduction in Firmicutes abundance and a trend of enrichment in Bac- teroidetes compared with placebo [56]. In the current study, we found that changes in the alpha diversity index Shannon during intervention were significantly different between cinnamon and placebo. The rela- tive abundance of Terrisporobacter and Dialister was reduced, but Methanobrevibacter was increased by cinnamon compared with pla- cebo. Energy restriction for weight reduction has been associated with the reduction of Terrisporobacter [57]. A positive correlation has been reported between the prevalence of Dialister and elevated HbAlc concentrations in prediabetic patients [58]. Methanobrevibacter, a methanogenic microorganism, poses a risk factor for obesity because of its influence on the extraction of calories from dietary carbohydrates [59]. Whether the effects of cinnamon on Terrisporobacter, Dialister, and Methanobrevibacter contribute to the improvement in glucose profile requires further investigation.\"\n",

The genus has 250 different species, but only 4 are commercially cultivated to produce the cinnamon spice. One of these is C. burmannii, or Indo- nesian cinnamon, which was used in our study. Cinnamon has a long history of use as a culinary spice, food preservative, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory agent [60-62]. The composition of cinnamon also varies across species. Cinnamaldehyde, proanthocyanidin, and espe- cially coumarin concentrations were found in C. burmannii [52]. In addition, C. burmannii was previously found to have 1 of the highest amounts of polyphenols (618~\\\\mu g/mg Gallic acid equivalent) [53]. Cinnamon has had traditional use for glucose lowering, and it continues to be investigated for its potential in glycemic control for individuals with overweight and obesity with prediabetes and diabetes [50].\"\n",

We included individuals with obesity and prediabetes such that our findings may not generalize to individuals with lesser degrees of glucose intolerance or insulin resistance. The small number of participants studied may not be population representative of all individuals with prediabetes and obesity. However, the relatively small sample did provide sufficient statistical power to detect a signifi- cant difference between cinnamon and placebo interventions in nearly 700 repeated days of observations in a crossover design. The study\\'s relatively short duration only examined the acute effects of cinnamon. Our results do not necessarily reflect the chronic effects of this spice on glucose homeostasis. The short duration was necessary to successfully conduct this complicated study that was dependent on a high degree of patient cooperation. We did not monitor participants\\' daily dietary intake and physical activity records during the intervention period, but we did assess adherence to the beige diet with 3-d food records. It is possible that participant behavior differed between time periods, but this is not likely given the relatively short duration of the entire study.

No statistical adjustment was made in an effort to control for po- tential carryover effects; however, they were unlikely because there was no interaction between the cinnamon effect and time. We did not perform a safety evaluation of liver toxicity in our study. The daily dose of cin- namon in our study (coumarin: 0.17~mg/kg body weight) was slightly greater than the Tolerable Daily Intake for coumarin (0.1~mg/kg body weight [63,64]). We did not believe a safety evaluation was necessary because the European Food Safety Authority\\'s has concluded that there are no safety concerns for cinnamon ingestion exceeding 3 times the Tolerable Daily Intake of coumarin for as long as 1-2 wk [65]. We did not measure phenolic metabolites in blood or urine. There was a risk of imprecise measurement of continuous glucose concentrations. We did not adjust for testing of multiple secondary outcomes. For that reason, the secondary outcomes should be considered exploratory.\"\n",

Objectives: To determine the effect of daily cinnamon spice supplementation in an amount commonly used for seasoning on glucose concentrations in adults with obesity and prediabetes. Methods: Following a 2-wk run-in period of maintaining a low polyphenol/fiber diet, 18 participants with obesity and prediabetes underwent a 10-wk randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial (mean age 51.1 y; mean fasting plasma glucose 102.9~mg/dL). The participants were randomly assigned to take cinnamon (4~g/d) or placebo for 4-wk, followed by a 2-wk washout period, and then crossed over to the other intervention for an additional 4-wk. Glucose changes were measured with continuous glucose monitoring. Oral glucose tolerance testing immediately following ingestion of cinnamon or placebo was performed at 4-time points to assess their acute effects both at the baseline and end of each intervention phase. Digestive symptom logs were obtained daily.\"\n",

We conducted a 4-wk randomized, controlled, double-blind cross- over trial to evaluate the effects of cinnamon consumption on glucose changes throughout the day, as measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in participants with prediabetes and obesity. We also assessed glucose, metabolic, and hormonal responses to oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) during acute administration of cin- namon and glucose using a modified OGTT protocol at 4 different time points during the study. Blood and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations were measured by gas chromatography. We hypothesized that cinnamon spice consumption results in sustained lowering of blood glucose concentrations.\\n\\n## Methods\"\n",

CGM data for each individual were collected and organized into daily seg- ments (24 h - from around 08:00 to 08:00). To establish the start time for each day, we calculated the mean time of day the glucose sensor was applied for each person (start time ranged between 07:30 and 08:30). We excluded days that were not representative of normal daily activity, such as days when OGTT was performed and the first 24 h after applying the sensor. We calculated the mean glucose concentra- tions (every 15~min/d) for each participant for the 2 interventions (cinnamon or placebo). Eventually, we had a day with 96 glucose mean observations (every 15 min) for each intervention. Glucose concen- trations were reported as changing relative to the initial glucose mea- surement.

Glucose changes were assessed by calculation of the glucose AUC using the net incremental AUC method (netAUC) [25-27]. NetAUC calculation includes the areas below a curve, both above and below the level of fasting time periods. The netAUC can result in values <0 since it is calculated as positive and negative blood glucose increments. Within-subject differences were determined by estimating the mean net incremental area under the 24-h glucose-time curve [25-27] and tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon Signed rank testing. Individual glycemic-response parameters were also determined: peak glucose height, peak start time, time to glucose peak, and mean peak duration. Peak values were determined from the difference of the highest measurement relative to the mean glucose concentration for the corresponding time period. Statistical significance between cinnamon and placebo glycemic responses was determined by Wilcoxon Signed rank testing.\"\n",

Mixed-model analysis was performed, treating subjects as random effects (within-subject test) with the intervention as a fixed effect (between-subject factor) and the outcome being the glucose concen- tration. Additional adjustments for potential confounders were added to the model (sex, age, and FPG at baseline/HbA1c at baseline/systolic or diastolic blood pressure). Mixed-model analysis was also used in the OGTT analysis (every 30 min over 3 h after glucose load). Exploratory analysis comparing differences between various time points during OGTT used Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

Analysis of covariance model was used to evaluate the differences in body composition and anthropometric adjusted for age, sex, and baseline measurements. Potential carryover effects from the first phase treatment allocation were minimized with the 2-wk washout period that should have been sufficiently long for the cinnamon effect to be depleted [4]. The washout period in our study is consistent with previous publications that employed a washout period of 7-20 d (2,5,6). The risk of potential carryover effects was evaluated by the interaction of the intervention order and the treatment in repeated mixed-models [29]. Effect size was calculated as Eta-squared (\\\\eta^{2}). Statistical significance was assumed if the 2-sided P<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 29.0 software. Graphs were constructed using GraphPad Prism 9 by Dot- matics.

The potential for the carryover effect of cinnamon from the initial to the final time period was evaluated by testing for an interaction between treatments, and the order of intervention allocation was not statistically significant (P=0.5).

Compliance with treatment admin- istration was excellent, and there were no digestive side effects. Post- prandial GIP was increased, and triglyceride concentrations decreased in response to an oral glucose load after 4 wk of cinnamon supple- mentation. Cinnamon was encapsulated in this research study to ach- ieve accurate dosing, blinding, and compliance. In practice, the 4 g cinnamon doses used in this study, which equate to the contents of a typical sugar packet, can easily be incorporated into foods.\"\n",

Our OGTT findings were similar to a previous study that showed that cinnamon did not affect postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations [30]. OGTT testing has less than optimal reliability, accuracy, and reproducibility [31]. Because it measures glucose over long time periods, 24-interstitial glucose moni- toring may be superior to OGTT in detecting dysglycemia in impaired glucose tolerance [32,33]. CGM is a powerful tool that has the principal advantage of capturing glucose fluctuations (short-term glycemic vari- ability) [34,35]. Our study may differ from those that did not find an effect of cinnamon on glucose concentrations because we employed 24-h CGM, which is a more sensitive measure of glucose changes than other methods.\"\n",

Triglyceride reduction in response to OGTT likely results from insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis, down-regulation of hepatic VLDL secretion [39,40], and upregulation of triglyceride clearance from the circulation by lipo- protein lipase and remnant receptors [41,42]. In addition, we observed that GIP concentrations were increased after 4 wk of cinnamon intake. GIP, an incretin produced in the intestinal mucosa, increases insulin concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner while also promoting ẞ-cell proliferation and survival [43-46]. GIP stimulates adipocyte li- poprotein lipase activity, resulting in hydrolysis of circulating tri- glycerides [47,48]. However, the increased triglycerides after a glucose load might be caused by insulin resistance with reduced hepatic fatty acid oxidation, causing triglycerides to increase rather than decrease after a glucose load [39,40]. The presence of obesity and prediabetes among the participants in our study may potentially explain the fluc- tuations observed in triglyceride concentrations.\"\n",

Our previous in vitro study demonstrated that cinnamon and other spices strongly influenced bacterial growth by enhancing the growth of Bifidobacterium spp and Lactobacillus spp, with inhibitory activity against selected Ruminococcus species, Fusobacterium strains and selected Clostridium spp [55]. One prior study in healthy participants showed that daily consumption of a spice mix resulted in a significant reduction in Firmicutes abundance and a trend of enrichment in Bac- teroidetes compared with placebo [56]. In the current study, we found that changes in the alpha diversity index Shannon during intervention were significantly different between cinnamon and placebo. The rela- tive abundance of Terrisporobacter and Dialister was reduced, but Methanobrevibacter was increased by cinnamon compared with pla- cebo. Energy restriction for weight reduction has been associated with the reduction of Terrisporobacter [57]. A positive correlation has been reported between the prevalence of Dialister and elevated HbAlc concentrations in prediabetic patients [58].\"\n",

The genus has 250 different species, but only 4 are commercially cultivated to produce the cinnamon spice. One of these is C. burmannii, or Indo- nesian cinnamon, which was used in our study. Cinnamon has a long history of use as a culinary spice, food preservative, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory agent [60-62]. The composition of cinnamon also varies across species. Cinnamaldehyde, proanthocyanidin, and espe- cially coumarin concentrations were found in C. burmannii [52]. In addition, C. burmannii was previously found to have 1 of the highest amounts of polyphenols (618~\\\\mu g/mg Gallic acid equivalent) [53]. Cinnamon has had traditional use for glucose lowering, and it continues to be investigated for its potential in glycemic control for individuals with overweight and obesity with prediabetes and diabetes [50].\"\n",

To minimize this risk, we used a washout time period duration of 2-wk that was used in prior studies field [12,13, 30]. No statistical adjustment was made in an effort to control for po- tential carryover effects; however, they were unlikely because there was no interaction between the cinnamon effect and time. We did not perform a safety evaluation of liver toxicity in our study. The daily dose of cin- namon in our study (coumarin: 0.17~mg/kg body weight) was slightly greater than the Tolerable Daily Intake for coumarin (0.1~mg/kg body weight [63,64]). We did not believe a safety evaluation was necessary because the European Food Safety Authority\\'s has concluded that there are no safety concerns for cinnamon ingestion exceeding 3 times the Tolerable Daily Intake of coumarin for as long as 1-2 wk [65]. We did not measure phenolic metabolites in blood or urine. There was a risk of imprecise measurement of continuous glucose concentrations. We did not adjust for testing of multiple secondary outcomes. For that reason, the secondary outcomes should be considered exploratory.\"\n",

The excellent compliance rate for capsule intake was similar for both cinnamon and placebo. There was a good participant retention rate, with no dropouts from the randomization phase. Our study is novel in that we evaluated cinna- mon\\'s effect on glucose excursions using CGM in addition to OGTT co-administered with cinnamon or placebo at 4-time points during the study. We also determined the effects of cinnamon on the microbiome, SCFA, and body composition. Finally, we studied the effects of a 4 g/ d cinnamon dose in contrast to previous studies that administered either 1-2~g/d or 6~g/d. In conclusion, our study suggests that adding cinnamon, a substance naturally rich in polyphenols, to daily diets may have beneficial gly- cemic effects in prediabetes.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nDr. Poon had been the pharmacist for compounding multiple dietary supplements for clinical trial studies at the University of California, Los Angeles Center for Human Nutrition.\"\n",

    "### Notes on tokens and chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs generally work with `tokens` rather than words. When dealing with text, a token often represents subsections of words, and tokenization can be done in different ways, such as breaking text up by characters, or using subword-based tokenization (e.g., the word \"unbelievable\" could be split into subwords such as \"un\", \"believe\", \"able\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact size and definition of a token can vary based on different tokenization methods, models, languages, and other factors, but a general rule of thumb for English text using subword tokenizers is around 4 characters per token on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating embeddings, we usually break a document into chunks and then create embeddings of those chunks. Again, this can be done in different ways, using different tools. In this notebook, we're using Google Cloud Document AI to break our documents into chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, one of the parameters we need to specify for our Document AI Processor is the `chunkSize` to use, which is measured (in this case) by number of tokens per chunk. You may need to experiment with the value for this parameter to find the chunk size that works best for your use case (e.g., based on the length and structure of the document sections). You generally want your chunks to capture some level of semantic granularity, but there are trade-offs in terms of this granularity. For example, smaller chunks can capture more granular sematic context, and can provide more precise search results, but can be less efficient (computationally) to process. You also need to ensure chunks sizes are within the input length limits of the embedding model you're using in order to avoid possible truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good practice is to start with a moderate chunk size and adjust it based on how well it fits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Document AI can automatically handle some chunking based on layout, even without a set chunkSize, so that can be helpful if you don't know what chunk size to use."

Objectives: To determine the effect of daily cinnamon spice supplementation in an amount commonly used for seasoning on glucose concentrations in adults with obesity and prediabetes. Methods: Following a 2-wk run-in period of maintaining a low polyphenol/fiber diet, 18 participants with obesity and prediabetes underwent a 10-wk randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial (mean age 51.1 y; mean fasting plasma glucose 102.9~mg/dL). The participants were randomly assigned to take cinnamon (4~g/d) or placebo for 4-wk, followed by a 2-wk washout period, and then crossed over to the other intervention for an additional 4-wk. Glucose changes were measured with continuous glucose monitoring. Oral glucose tolerance testing immediately following ingestion of cinnamon or placebo was performed at 4-time points to assess their acute effects both at the baseline and end of each intervention phase. Digestive symptom logs were obtained daily.', '# Effect of cinnamon spice on continuously monitored glycemic response in adults with prediabetes: a 4-week randomized controlled crossover trial\\n\\n## ABSTRACT\\n\\nResults: There were 694 follow-up days with 66,624 glucose observations. When compared with placebo, 24-h glucose concentrations were significantly lower when cinnamon was administered [mixed-models; effect size (ES) = 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.9, -1.5; P<0.0017. Similarly, the mean net-area-under-the-curve (netAUC) for glucose was significantly lower than for placebo when cinnamon was given (over 24 h; ES=-0.66:95\\\\% CI: 2501.7, 5412.1, P=0.01). Cinnamon supplementation resulted in lower glucose peaks compared with placebo (Apeak 9.56\\\\pm9.1~mg/dI compared with 11.73\\\\pm8.0~mg/dL; ES = -0.57; 95% CI: 0.8, 3.7, P=0.027). Glucose-dependent-insulinotropic-polypeptide concentrations increased during oral glucose tolerance testing + cinnamon testing (mixed-models; ES = 0.51; 95% CI: 1.56, 100.1, P=0.04, whereas triglyceride concentrations decreased (mixed-models; ES=0.55; 95% CI: -16.0, -1.6, P=0.02. Treatment adherence was excellent in both groups (cinnamon: 97.6\\\\pm3.4\\\\% compared with placebo: 979+37\\\\%; ES=-0.15. 95% CI: -1.8, 0.2, P=0.5. No differences were found in digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, borborygmi, bloating, excess flatus, and stools/day) between cinnamon and placebo groups.', '# Effect of cinnamon spice on continuously monitored glycemic response in adults with prediabetes: a 4-week randomized controlled crossover trial\\n\\n## ABSTRACT\\n\\nConclusions: Cinnamon, a widely available and low-cost supplement, may contribute to better glucose control when added to the diet in people who have obesity-related prediabetes.

      "##  Cinnamon and Prediabetes Management: Dietary and Lifestyle Interactions\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon, a popular spice, has garnered interest for its potential role in managing prediabetes. While research is ongoing, evidence suggests cinnamon may offer benefits when combined with other dietary and lifestyle interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dietary Interactions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fiber:** Combining cinnamon with high-fiber foods can amplify its blood sugar-lowering effects. Fiber slows down digestion and carbohydrate absorption, leading to a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels. \n",
      "* **Low-Glycemic Index (GI) Foods:** Pairing cinnamon with low-GI foods further contributes to better blood sugar control. These foods cause a slower and smaller rise in blood sugar compared to high-GI foods. \n",
      "* **Antioxidant-Rich Foods:** Combining cinnamon with antioxidant-rich fruits, vegetables, and nuts can offer additional benefits. Antioxidants may help protect against oxidative stress, a factor associated with diabetes development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lifestyle Interactions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Physical Activity:** Regular physical activity, especially moderate-intensity exercise, improves insulin sensitivity and helps manage blood sugar levels. Combining cinnamon with exercise can potentially enhance these effects.\n",
      "* **Weight Management:** Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for prediabetes management. Cinnamon, when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, may support weight loss efforts.\n",
      "* **Stress Management:** Chronic stress can negatively impact blood sugar control. Incorporating stress-reducing techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing alongside cinnamon consumption may be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Limited Research:** While research on cinnamon and prediabetes is promising, more studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness and optimal dosage.\n",
      "* **Individual Variability:**  Responses to cinnamon can vary depending on individual factors like genetics and overall health. Consulting a healthcare professional is crucial to determine the appropriate approach for each person.\n",
      "* **Potential Side Effects:** Cinnamon is generally safe for most people when consumed in moderate amounts. However, high doses may cause side effects like mouth sores, diarrhea, and lowered blood sugar levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Cinnamon, as part of a comprehensive approach that includes dietary modifications, regular exercise, weight management, and stress reduction, may offer additional benefits for managing prediabetes. However, further research is needed to fully understand its role and optimal use. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to remember that cinnamon is not a magic bullet and should be used in conjunction with other healthy lifestyle choices. Consulting a healthcare professional can provide personalized guidance on incorporating cinnamon into a prediabetes management plan.\n"

      "\n",
      "Your provided references offer valuable information on the potential of cinnamon in managing prediabetes, particularly in the context of a 4-week randomized controlled crossover trial. Here's an analysis of how cinnamon might interact with other dietary and lifestyle interventions based on the provided context:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dietary Interactions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fiber and Low-GI Foods:** The study design doesn't explicitly mention the participants' dietary intake of fiber or low-GI foods. However, it's important to note that a balanced diet rich in fiber and low-GI options would likely enhance the blood sugar-lowering effects observed with cinnamon supplementation. \n",
      "* **Antioxidant-Rich Foods:** Similarly, the study doesn't detail the participants' intake of antioxidant-rich foods. Nevertheless, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts alongside cinnamon could offer additional benefits for managing oxidative stress, a contributing factor to diabetes development.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Cinnamon Supplementation and Prediabetes Management: Interactions from Specific Context\n",
      " \n",
      "Based solely on the provided references, which discuss a  study on cinnamon's effect on prediabetes using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM), here's an analysis of potential interactions with dietary and lifestyle interventions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dietary Interactions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Limited Information:  The provided context doesn't offer details  about participants' dietary intake. Therefore, it's impossible to  conclusively determine interactions based solely on this limited data.  A broader understanding requires information on dietary factors like  fiber, Glycemic Index (GI), and antioxidant intake.**\n",
      " * **General Recommendations: The general recommendations for prediabetes management still apply. Combining cinnamon with a balanced diet rich in fiber, low-GI foods, and antioxidants would likely maximize potential benefits. However, it's critical to consult a healthcare professional for specific dietary guidance considering individual needs.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lifestyle Interactions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Physical Activity:** Similarly, the provided study doesn't mention participants' physical activity levels. Nonetheless, consistent exercise is crucial for improved insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. Combining cinnamon with an active lifestyle could potentially augment these positive effects. However, research specifically investigating this interaction with  prediabetes is limited within this  context.**\n",
      " \n",
      " * **Weight Management:  Again, no weight data or information  related to weight management efforts are available within this context. Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial. Combining cinnamon with a balanced diet and regular exercise might support weight loss, but research needs to  specifically evaluate such interaction within the context of a  prediabetes intervention for better clarity.*\n",
      " \n",
      " **Stress Management: Similar  limitations regarding stress management exist as in other categories mentioned above.**\n",
      "* **General  Recommendations: Consistent with overall prediabetes management  recommendations, combining cinnamon with stress-reducing techniques might offer additional benefits. Techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing  could help mitigate stress, which may improve blood sugar control. However, specific research in a prediabetes context  with this  approach within our limited references needs to be considered and further exploration is crucial.*\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the lack of explicit interactions within the specific context of the provided studies, general insights recommend considering cinnamon alongside other healthy lifestyle changes for effective prediabetes management: a balanced diet, physical activity, weight management, and stress reduction. \n",
      "\n",
      "Individual variations and the need for a customized approach remain crucial. Consultation with a healthcare professional based on comprehensive information can ensure optimal strategies for each individual with prediabetes. This tailored approach is necessary for safe and effective cinnamon integration within a holistic management plan while accounting for unique factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a thorough understanding, additional research exploring cinnamon's specific interactions within a prediabetic context with other intervention types is vital. This can offer more conclusive evidence and support individualized treatment strategies for managing prediabetes.\n"
